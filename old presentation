In 2012, I created a website and used Phoca to hold a PDF presentation.  I have since deleted EVERYTHING from that old website and built a new one.  Unfortunately, that old Phoca file still shows up when you 'google' the name of my company (see http://www.us-restaurant-alliance.com/phocadownload/presentation%20to%20independent%20restaurants.pdf).  I need to remove that old Phoca file.  Keep in mind, I cannot find it on my site (visually and when using search).  Others have told me that 1) it could be stored on the joomlacode.org server.  Others have told me that since it only shows up on Google searches, it is only on a Google server.  I have asked Google numerous times in the last 2 weeks to refresh their bot searches (to delete this old file and replace with new files) ... but nothing changes.  Help!!!!!!!!!!!
